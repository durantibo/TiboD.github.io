					<p>As an individual brimming with ambition and drive, I am thrilled to embark on the next phase of my illustrious career as I approach my <b> graduation in the Spring of 2023 </b>. My extensive interests in the cutting-edge fields of <b> molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and molecular modeling (MM), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) </b> have fueled my passion to not just excel but to revolutionize in these domains. My fervor to make a meaningful impact in the industry has led me to seek out dynamic and innovative organizations where I can put my skills and expertise to the test. Through a combination of rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I have not only honed my abilities but also gained invaluable experience that has shaped me into a well-rounded and adaptable candidate, ready to hit the ground running in a diverse array of roles. I am confident in my ability to leave a lasting impression in any position within these fields and am eagerly looking forward to exploring the various opportunities available to me.</p>
					
					<p>Over the past few years, I have devoted myself to the pursuit of excellence in the field of pharmacutics, biopharmacutics, nanoparticles and biotherapeutics. My extensive experience in engineering biologics using state-of-the-art molecular modeling software such as GROMACS, CHARMM, Schr√∂dinger, VMD, and Pymol, has enabled me to push the boundaries of what is possible in this field. I am fluent with several modern programming languages such as Python and Matlab, along with my ability to implement novel computational methods to solve complex research challenges, has further cemented my position as a leader in my field. My expertise in developing and implementing computational strategies to guide the design of drug and small molecules with desired biological and development characteristics, has been honed through years of experience working within multi-disciplinary teams to apply computational chemistry techniques, cheminformatics, and diverse molecular modeling approaches for the purpose of executing chemical screening campaigns, supporting medicinal chemistry activities in drug design, and advancing small-molecule drug discovery programs. My knowledge of computational biophysics and computational chemistry, as well as my experience with coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics, has been instrumental in making substantial contributions to the field of computational science. I am honored to have played a part in advancing the state of the art in this field and am eager to continue my research and make even more impactful contributions in the future.</p>

		Freezing is a widely used technique in the pharmaceutical industry for the preservation and transportation of biotherapeutics. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and molecular details of protein destabilization upon freezing, multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations of Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) protein in phosphate buffer with/without ice formation were performed. The simulations were conducted under both fast and slow ice-growing conditions at 243 K, from one or two sides of the simulation box, respectively. The results showed that the rate of ice formation at all-atom simulations was crucial to the stability of LDH, as faster freezing rates resulted in enhanced structural stability and a higher number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, less flexible protein residues, lower solvent accessibility, and greater structural compactness. Additionally, protein aggregation was investigated through coarse-grained simulations and was found to be initiated by extended protein structures and retained by electrostatic interactions of salt bridges between charged residues and hydrogen bonds between polar residues of the protein. Lastly, the study of the free energy of dissociation through steered molecular dynamics simulation revealed that LDH was destabilized by the solvation of the hydrophobic core and the loss of hydrophobic interactions. This study, for the first time, provides experimentally validated molecular simulations that reveal the detailed mechanisms of LDH destabilization upon ice formation and cryoconcentration of solutes, and it will help to improve the preservation and transportation of biotherapeutics.
